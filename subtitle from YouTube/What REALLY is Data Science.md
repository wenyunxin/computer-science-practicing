Data science is not about making complicated models. It's not about making awesome visualizations. It's not about writing code. **Data science is about using data to create as much impact as possible for your company**. Now impact can be in the form of multiple things. It could be in the form of insights, in the form of data products or in the form of product recommendations for a company. Now to do those things, then you need tools like making complicated models or data visualizations or writing code. But essentially as a data scientist your job is to solve real company problems using data and what kind of tools you use we don't care. Now there's a lot of misconception about data science, especially on YouTube and I think the reason for this is because there's a huge misalignment between what's popular to talk about and what's needed in the industry. So because of that I want to make things clear. I am a data scientist working for a GAFA company and those companies really emphasize on using data to improve their products. So this is my take on what is data science. 

> 数据科学不是关于制作复杂的模型。它不是关于制作令人敬畏的可视化。它不是关于写代码。**数据科学是关于使用数据来为你的公司创造尽可能多的影响**。现在，影响可以是多种形式的。它可以是洞察力的形式，可以是数据产品的形式，也可以是为公司提供产品建议的形式。现在要做这些事情，那么你需要一些工具，如制作复杂的模型或数据可视化或编写代码。但从本质上讲，作为一个数据科学家，你的工作是使用数据解决公司的实际问题，而你使用什么样的工具我们并不关心。现在有很多关于数据科学的误解，特别是在YouTube上，我认为其原因是，在流行谈论的内容和行业需要的内容之间存在着巨大的错位。所以正因为如此，我想把事情说清楚。我是一个在GAFA公司工作的数据科学家，这些公司真正强调的是使用数据来改善他们的产品。所以这是我对什么是数据科学的看法。

Before data science, we popularized the term data mining in an article called from data mining to knowledge discovery in databases in 1996 in which it referred to the overall process of discovering useful information from data. In 2001, William S. Cleveland wanted to bring data mining to another level. He did that by combining computer science with data mining. Basically He made statistics a lot more technical which he believed would expand the possibilities of data mining and produce a powerful force for innovation. Now you can take advantage of compute power for statistics and he called this combo data science. Around this time this is also when web 2.0 emerged where websites are no longer just a digital pamphlet, but a medium for a shared experience amongst millions and millions of users. These are web sites like **MySpace** in 2003, **Facebook** in 2004 and **YouTube** in 2005. We can now interact with these web sites meaning we can contribute post comment like upload share leaving our footprint in the digital landscape we call Internet and help create and shape the ecosystem we now know and love today. And guess what? That's a lot of data so much data, it became too much to handle using traditional technologies. So we call this **Big Data**. That opened a world of possibilities in finding insights using data. But it also meant that the simplest questions require sophisticated data infrastructure just to support the handling of the data. We needed parallel computing technology like **MapReduce**, **Hadoop**, and **Spark** so the rise of big data in 2010 sparked the rise of data science to support the needs of the businesses to draw insights from their massive unstructured data sets. So then the journal of data science described data science as almost everything that has something to do with data Collecting analyzing modeling. Yet the most important part is its applications. All sorts of applications. Yes, all sorts of applications like machine learning. 

> 在数据科学之前，我们在1996年一篇名为《从数据挖掘到数据库中的知识发现》的文章中普及了数据挖掘这个词，在这篇文章中，它指的是从数据中发现有用信息的整体过程。2001年，William S. Cleveland想把数据挖掘带到另一个层次。他通过将计算机科学与数据挖掘相结合来做到这一点。基本上，他使统计学变得更加技术化，他相信这将扩大数据挖掘的可能性，并产生强大的创新力量。现在你可以利用计算能力进行统计，他把这种组合称为数据科学。大约在这个时候，也是web2.0出现的时候，网站不再只是一个数字小册子，而是一个在数以百万计的用户中分享经验的媒介。这些网站包括2003年的**MySpace**，2004年的**Facebook**和2005年的**YouTube**。我们现在可以与这些网站互动，这意味着我们可以发表评论，喜欢上传分享，在我们称之为互联网的数字景观中留下我们的足迹，并帮助创造和塑造我们今天所知道和喜爱的生态系统。你猜怎么着？那是大量的数据，这么多的数据，使用传统技术已经无法处理了。所以我们称之为**大数据**。这为利用数据寻找洞察力打开了一个可能性的世界。但这也意味着，最简单的问题也需要复杂的数据基础设施来支持对数据的处理。我们需要像**MapReduce**、**Hadoop**和**Spark**这样的并行计算技术，所以2010年大数据的兴起引发了数据科学的兴起，以支持企业从其大规模的非结构化数据集中获得洞察力的需求。所以当时的数据科学杂志将数据科学描述为几乎所有与数据收集分析建模有关的东西。然而最重要的部分是它的应用。各种各样的应用。是的，各种各样的应用，如机器学习。

So in 2010 with the new abundance of data it made it possible to train machines with a data-driven approach rather than a knowledge driven approach. All the theoretical papers about recurring **neural networks** support **vector machines** became feasible. Something that can change the way we live and how we experience things in the world. **Deep learning** is no longer an academic concept in these thesis paper. It became a tangible useful class of machine learning that would affect our everyday lives. So machine learning and AI dominated the media overshadowing every other aspect of data science like exploratory analysis, experimentation, ... And skills we traditionally called **business intelligence**. So now the general public think of data science as researchers focused on machine learning and AI. but the industry is hiring data scientists as analysts. So there's a misalignment there. The reason for the misalignment is that yes, most of these data scientists can probably work on more technical problems but big companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix have so many low-hanging fruits to improve their products that they don't require any advanced machine learning or statistical knowledge to find these impacts in their analysis. Being a good data scientist isn't about how advanced your models are. It's about how much impact you can have with your work. You're not a data cruncher. You're a **problem solver**. You're **strategists**. Companies will give you the most ambiguous and hard problems. And we expect you to guide the company to the right direction.

> 所以在2010年，随着新的大量数据的出现，使得用数据驱动的方法而不是知识驱动的方法来训练机器成为可能。所有关于循环**神经网络**支持**向量机**的理论论文变得可行了。一些可以改变我们的生活方式以及我们如何体验世界上的事物。在这些论文中，**深度学习**不再是一个学术概念。它成为了一个实实在在的有用的机器学习类别，将影响我们的日常生活。因此，机器学习和人工智能主导了媒体，使数据科学的每一个其他方面都黯然失色，如探索性分析、实验、......。以及我们传统上称为**商业智能**的技能。因此，现在一般人都认为数据科学是专注于机器学习和人工智能的研究人员。但业界却把数据科学家当作分析员来雇用。所以那里有一个错位。错位的原因是，是的，这些数据科学家中的大多数可能可以从事更多的技术问题，但像谷歌、Facebook和Netflix这样的大公司有许多低垂的果实来改进他们的产品，他们不需要任何高级机器学习或统计知识来在分析中找到这些影响。成为一名优秀的数据科学家并不在于你的模型有多先进。而是看你的工作能产生多大的影响。你不是一个数据计算者。你是一个**问题解决者**。你是**战略家**。公司会给你最模糊和困难的问题。而我们希望你能引导公司走向正确的方向。

Ok, now I want to conclude with real-life examples of data science jobs in Silicon Valley. But first I have to print some charts. So let's go do that (conversation not directly related to the topic). So this is a very useful chart that tells you the needs of data science. Now, it's pretty obvious but sometimes we kind of forget about it now. At the bottom of the pyramid we have collect you obviously have to collect some sort of data to be able to use that data. So collect storing transforming all of these data engineering effort is pretty important and it's actually quite captured pretty well in media because of big data we talked about how difficult it is to manage all this data. We talked about parallel computing which means like Hadoop and Spark Stuff like that. We know about this. Now the thing that's less known is the stuff in between which is right here everything that's here and Surprisingly this is actually one of the most important things for companies because you're trying to tell the company what to do with your product. So what do I mean by that? So I'm an analytics that tells you using the data what kind of insights can tell me what are happening to my users and then metrics this is important because what's going on with my product? You know, these metrics will tell you if you're successful or not. And then also, you know a be testing of course. **Experimentation that allows you to know, which product versions are the best**. So these things are actually really important but they're not so covered in media. What's covered in media is this part. **AI**, **deep learning**. We've heard it on and on about it, you know. But when you think about it for a company, for the industry, It's actually not the highest priority or at least it's not the thing that yields the most result for the lowest amount of effort. That's why AI and deep learning is on top of the hierarchy of needs and these things may be testing analytics they're actually way more important for industry so that's why we're hiring a lot of data scientists that does that. 

> 好了，现在我想用硅谷的数据科学工作的真实例子来结束。但首先我得打印一些图表。所以我们去做吧（与主题没有直接关系的谈话）。所以这是一个非常有用的图表，告诉你数据科学的需求。现在，这很明显，但有时我们现在有点忘记了。在金字塔的底部，我们有收集你显然必须收集某种数据，以便能够使用这些数据。因此，收集存储转化所有这些数据的工程努力是相当重要的，它实际上在媒体中被很好地捕捉到了，因为大数据我们谈到了管理所有这些数据是多么困难。我们谈到了并行计算，这意味着像Hadoop和Spark之类的东西。我们知道这些。现在，鲜为人知的是中间的东西，也就是这里的一切，令人惊讶的是，这实际上是公司最重要的事情之一，因为你正试图告诉公司该如何处理你的产品。那么我的意思是什么呢？所以我是一个分析，告诉你使用数据，什么样的洞察力可以告诉我，我的用户正在发生什么，然后指标这很重要，因为我的产品正在发生什么？你知道，这些指标会告诉你，如果你成功或不成功。然后还有，你知道一个是当然的测试。**实验，让你知道，哪个产品版本是最好的**。因此，这些东西实际上是非常重要的，但它们没有被媒体报道。媒体所报道的是这一部分。**AI**，**深度学习**。我们已经不断地听到它，你知道。但是当你考虑到它对一个公司，对一个行业来说，它实际上不是最优先的，或者至少不是以最少的努力产生最大的结果的事情。这就是为什么人工智能和深度学习处于需求层次的顶端，这些东西可能是测试分析，它们实际上对行业更重要，所以这就是为什么我们要雇用大量的数据科学家来做这个。

So what do data scientists actually do? Well that depends on the company because of them as of the size. So for a start-up you kind of lack resources. So you can only kind of have one DS. So that one data scientist he has to do everything. So you might be seeing all all this being data scientists. Maybe you won't be doing AI or deep learning because that's not a priority right now. But you might be doing all of these. You have to set up the whole **data infrastructure**. You might even have to write some **software code** to add logging and then you have to do the analytics yourself, then you have to build the metrics yourself, and you have to do **A/B testing** yourself. That's why for startups if they need a data scientist this whole thing is data science, so that means you have to do everything. But let's look at medium-sized companies. Now, finally they have a lot more resources. They can separate the data engineers and the data scientists So usually in collection, this is probably software engineering. And then here, you're gonna have data engineers doing this. And then depending if you're medium-sized company does a lot of recommendation models or stuff that requires AI, then DS will do all these Right. So as a data scientist, you have to be a lot more technical. That's why they only hire people with PhDs or masters because they want you to be able to do the more complicated things. So let's talk about large company now. Because you're getting a lot bigger you probably have a lot more money and then you can spend it more on employees. So you can have a lot of different employees working on different things. That way the employee does not need to think about this stuff that they don't want to do and they could focus on the things that they're best at. For example, me and my untitled large company I would be in analytics so I could just focus my work on analytics and metrics and stuff like that. So I don't need to worry about data engineering or AI and deep learning stuff. So here's how it looks for a large company. Instrumental logging sensors. This is all handled by software engineers. Right? And then here, cleaning and building data pipelines. This is for data engineers. 

> 那么，数据科学家究竟是做什么的呢？这取决于公司，因为他们的规模。因此，对于一个初创公司来说，你有点缺乏资源。所以你只能有一个DS。所以那一个数据科学家必须做所有的事情。所以你可能会看到所有这些都是数据科学家。也许你不会做人工智能或深度学习，因为这不是现在的优先事项。但你可能会做所有这些。你必须建立整个**数据基础设施**。你甚至可能要写一些**软件代码**来添加日志，然后你要自己做分析，然后你要自己建立指标，你要自己做**A/B测试**。这就是为什么对于创业公司来说，如果他们需要一个数据科学家，这整个事情就是数据科学，所以这意味着你必须做所有事情。但是，让我们看看中等规模的公司。现在，他们终于有了更多的资源。他们可以把数据工程师和数据科学家分开 所以通常在收集，这可能是软件工程。然后在这里，你会有数据工程师做这个。然后取决于如果你是中型公司做很多推荐模型或需要人工智能的东西，那么DS会做所有这些权利。所以作为一个数据科学家，你必须要有更多的技术。这就是为什么他们只雇用博士或硕士的人，因为他们希望你能做更复杂的事情。所以我们现在来谈谈大公司。因为你的规模越来越大，你可能有更多的钱，然后你可以把钱花在员工身上。所以你可以有很多不同的员工从事不同的工作。这样，员工就不需要考虑这些他们不想做的事情，他们可以专注于他们最擅长的事情。例如，我和我的无名大公司我会在分析部门，所以我可以只把工作重点放在分析和指标之类的东西上。所以我不需要担心数据工程或人工智能和深度学习的东西。所以这里是一个大公司的样子。仪表记录传感器。这都是由软件工程师处理的。对吗？然后在这里，清理和建立数据管道。这是给数据工程师的。

Now here, between these two things, we have Data Science Analytics. That's what it's called. But then once we go to the AI and deep learning, this is where we have research scientists or we call it data science core and they are backed by and now engineers which are machine learning engineers. Yeah Anyways, so in summary, as you can see, data science can be all of this and it depends what company you are in. **And the definition will vary**. So please let me know what you would like to learn more about AI and deep learning, or A/B testing, experimentation,... Depending on what you want to learn about, leave a comment down below so I could talk about it or I could find someone who knows about this and I can share the insights with you.

> 现在在这里，在这两件事之间，我们有数据科学分析。这就是它的名称。但是，一旦我们进入人工智能和深度学习，这就是我们有研究科学家或我们称之为数据科学核心的地方，他们由现在的工程师支持，这是机器学习工程师。总之，综上所述，你可以看到，数据科学可以是所有这些，这取决于你在什么公司。**定义也会有所不同**。所以，请让我知道你想学习更多关于人工智能和深度学习的知识，或者A/B测试，实验，... 根据你想了解的内容，请在下面留言，以便我可以谈论它，或者我可以找到了解这方面的人，我可以与你分享见解。
