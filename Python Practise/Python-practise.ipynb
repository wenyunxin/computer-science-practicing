    "For Python, [**PEP 8**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use `UpperCamelCase` for classes and `lowercase_with_underscores` for functions and methods. Always use `self` as the name for the first method argument (see [A First Look at Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-firstclasses) for more on classes and methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 对于Python，[**PEP 8**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)已经成为大多数项目遵守的风格指南；它提倡一种非常可读和赏心悦目的编码风格。每个Python开发者都应该在某个时候阅读它；下面是为你摘录的最重要的几点。\n",

While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one).\n",
