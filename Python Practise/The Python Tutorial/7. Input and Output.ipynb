      " happier and healthier. Period.\n",
      " \n",

      " about relationships.\n",
      " \n",
      " The first is that social connections\n",
      " are really good for us,\n",
      " \n",
      " and that loneliness kills.\n",
      " \n",
      " It turns out that people\n",
      " who are more socially connected\n",
      " \n",
      " to family, to friends, to community,\n",
      " \n",
      " are happier, they're physically healthier,\n",
      " and they live longer\n",
      " \n",
      " than people who are less well connected.\n",
      " \n",
      " And the experience of loneliness\n",
      " turns out to be toxic.\n",
      " \n",
      " People who are more isolated\n",
      " than they want to be from others\n",
      " \n",
      " find that they are less happy,\n",
      " \n",
      " their health declines earlier in midlife,\n",
      " \n",
      " their brain functioning declines sooner\n",
      " \n",
      " and they live shorter lives\n",
      " than people who are not lonely.\n",
      " \n",
      " And the sad fact\n",
      " is that at any given time,\n",
      " \n",
      " more than one in five Americans\n",
      " will report that they're lonely.\n",
      " \n",
      " And we know that you\n",
      " can be lonely in a crowd\n",
      " \n",
      " and you can be lonely in a marriage,\n",
      " \n",
      " so the second big lesson that we learned\n",
      " \n",
      " is that it's not just\n",
      " the number of friends you have,\n",
      " \n",
      " and it's not whether or not\n",
      " you're in a committed relationship,\n",
      " \n",
      " but it's the quality\n",
      " of your close relationships that matters.\n",
      " \n",
      " It turns out that living in the midst\n",
      " of conflict is really bad for our health.\n",
      " \n",
      " High-conflict marriages, for example,\n",
      " without much affection,\n",
      " \n",
      " turn out to be very bad for our health,\n",
      " perhaps worse than getting divorced.\n",
      " \n",
      " And living in the midst of good,\n",
      " warm relationships is protective.\n",
      " \n",
      " Once we had followed our men\n",
      " all the way into their 80s,\n",
      " \n",
      " we wanted to look back at them at midlife\n",
      " \n",
      " and to see if we could predict\n",
      " \n",
      " who was going to grow\n",
      " into a happy, healthy octogenarian\n",
      " \n",
      " and who wasn't.\n",
      " \n",

      " everything we knew about them\n",
      " \n",
      " at age 50,\n",
      " \n",
      " it wasn't their middle age\n",
      " cholesterol levels\n",
      " \n",
      " that predicted how they\n",

      " \n",
      " It was how satisfied they were\n",

      " \n",

      " \n",
      " And good, close relationships\n",
      " seem to buffer us\n",
      " \n",

      " of getting old.\n",
      " \n",

      " \n",

      " \n",
      " And the third big lesson that we learned\n",

      " \n",
      " is that good relationships\n",
      " don't just protect our bodies,\n",

    "Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](http://json.org/).

    "Contrary to [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#tut-json), *pickle* is a protocol which allows the serialization of arbitrarily complex Python objects. As such, it is specific to Python and cannot be used to communicate with applications written in other languages. It is also insecure by default: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker.\n",
