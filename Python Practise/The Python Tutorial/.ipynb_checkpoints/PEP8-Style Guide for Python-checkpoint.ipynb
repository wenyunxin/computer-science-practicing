For example, the `os.stat()` function returns a tuple whose items traditionally have names like `st_mode`, `st_size`, `st_mtime` and so on. (This is done to emphasize the correspondence with the fields of the POSIX system call struct, which helps programmers familiar with that.)\n",

    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__double_leading_underscore`: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, `__boo` becomes `_FooBar__boo`; see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__`: “magic” objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. `__init__`, `__import__` or `__file__`. Never invent such names; only use them as documented."

    "Always decide whether a class’s methods and instance variables (collectively: “attributes”) should be public or non-public. If in doubt, choose non-public; it’s easier to make it public later than to make a public attribute non-public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public attributes are those that you expect unrelated clients of your class to use, with your commitment to avoid backwards incompatible changes. Non-public attributes are those that are not intended to be used by third parties; you make no guarantees that non-public attributes won’t change or even be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t use the term “private” here, since no attribute is really private in Python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another category of attributes are those that are part of the “subclass API” (often called “protected” in other languages). Some classes are designed to be inherited from, either to extend or modify aspects of the class’s behavior. When designing such a class, take care to make explicit decisions about which attributes are public, which are part of the subclass API, and which are truly only to be used by your base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, here are the Pythonic guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public attributes should have no leading underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your public attribute name collides with a reserved keyword, append a single trailing underscore to your attribute name. This is preferable to an abbreviation or corrupted spelling. (However, notwithstanding this rule, ‘cls’ is the preferred spelling for any variable or argument which is known to be a class, especially the first argument to a class method.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note 1: See the argument name recommendation above for class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For simple public data attributes, it is best to expose just the attribute name, without complicated accessor/mutator methods. Keep in mind that Python provides an easy path to future enhancement, should you find that a simple data attribute needs to grow functional behavior. In that case, use properties to hide functional implementation behind simple data attribute access syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note 1: Try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free, although side-effects such as caching are generally fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note 2: Avoid using properties for computationally expensive operations; the attribute notation makes the caller believe that access is (relatively) cheap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes that you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with double leading underscores and no trailing underscores. This invokes Python’s name mangling algorithm, where the name of the class is mangled into the attribute name. This helps avoid attribute name collisions should subclasses inadvertently contain attributes with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note 1: Note that only the simple class name is used in the mangled name, so if a subclass chooses both the same class name and attribute name, you can still get name collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note 2: Name mangling can make certain uses, such as debugging and `__getattr__()`, less convenient. However the name mangling algorithm is well documented and easy to perform manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note 3: Not everyone likes name mangling. Try to balance the need to avoid accidental name clashes with potential use by advanced callers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 始终决定一个类的方法(methods)和实例变量(instance variables)（统称：\"属性(attributes)\"）应该是公共的(public)还是非公共的(non-public)。如果有疑问，请选择非公共的；以后把它变成公共的比把公共属性变成非公共的要容易。\n",
    ">\n",

    ">\n",
    "> 考虑到这一点，下面是Pythonic指南：\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - 公共属性不应该有前导下划线。\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - 如果你的公共属性名称与一个保留关键字相冲突，请在你的属性名称**后面**加上一个下划线。这比缩写或破坏性的拼写更可取。(然而，尽管有这个规则，'cls' 是任何已知为类的变量或参数的首选拼写，特别是类方法的第一个参数。)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   注1：参见上面关于类方法的参数名称建议。\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - 对于简单的公共数据属性，最好只公开属性名称，而不公开复杂的访问器/混合器方法。请记住，如果你发现一个简单的数据属性需要增加功能行为，Python 提供了一个方便的途径来实现未来的增强。在这种情况下，使用属性将功能实现隐藏在简单的数据属性访问语法的后面。\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   注意1：尽量保持功能行为不受副作用影响，尽管像缓存这样的副作用通常是可以的。\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   注意2：避免将属性用于计算成本高的操作；属性符号使调用者相信访问是（相对）便宜的。\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - 如果你的类打算被子类化，并且你有不想让子类使用的属性，考虑用双头下划线和无尾下划线来命名它们。这将调用 Python 的名称混合算法，类的名称将被混合成属性名称。这有助于在子类无意中包含相同名称的属性时避免属性名称的冲突。\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   注意1：注意只有简单的类名被用于混杂的名称中，所以如果一个子类选择了相同的类名和属性名，你仍然可以得到名称碰撞。\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   注意 2: 名字混杂会使某些使用变得不那么方便，例如调试和 `__getattr__()`。然而，名称混杂的算法有很好的文件记录，并且很容易手动执行。\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   注意 3: 不是每个人都喜欢名字的混杂。试着在避免意外的名字冲突与高级调用者的潜在使用之间取得平衡。"
