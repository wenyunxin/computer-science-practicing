    "如果你在电脑上做了很多工作，最终你会发现有一些你想自动化的任务。例如，你可能希望对大量的文本文件进行搜索和替换，或者以一种复杂的方式重命名和重新排列一堆照片文件。也许你想写一个小型的自定义数据库，或一个专门的GUI应用程序，或一个简单的游戏。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你是一个专业的软件开发人员，你可能需要使用几个C/C++/Java库，但发现通常的写/编译/测试/再编译的周期太慢。也许你正在为这样的库写一个测试套件，并发现写测试代码是一项乏味的工作。或者你已经写了一个可以使用扩展语言的程序，而你不想为你的应用程序设计和实现一种全新的语言。\n",
    "\n",
    "Python正是适合你的语言。\n",
    "\n",
    "你可以写一个 Unix shell 脚本或 Windows 批处理文件来完成其中的一些任务，但 shell 脚本最擅长的是移动文件和改变文本数据，不适合 GUI 应用程序或游戏。你可以写一个C/C++/Java程序，但它可能需要大量的开发时间来获得甚至是一个初稿程序。Python使用起来更简单，可在Windows、macOS和Unix操作系统上使用，并能帮助你更快地完成工作。\n",
    "\n",
    "Python使用起来很简单，但它是一种真正的编程语言，为大型程序提供了比shell脚本或批处理文件所能提供的更多结构和支持。另一方面，Python也比C语言提供了更多的错误检查，而且作为一种非常高级的语言，它有内置的高级数据类型，如灵活的数组和字典。由于其更通用的数据类型，Python 适用于比 Awk 或甚至 Perl 更大的问题领域，然而许多事情在 Python 中至少和这些语言一样简单。\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 允许你将你的程序分割成可以在其他 Python 程序中重复使用的模块。它带有大量的标准模块，你可以把它们作为你的程序的基础---或者作为开始学习 Python 编程的例子。这些模块中的一些提供了诸如文件输入/输出、系统调用、套接字，甚至是与图形用户界面工具包如 Tk 的接口。\n",
    "\n",
    "Python是一种解释型语言，在程序开发过程中可以节省大量时间，因为不需要编译和链接。解释器可以交互使用，这使得实验该语言的特性、编写弃用程序或在自下而上的程序开发过程中测试功能变得容易。它也是一个方便的桌面计算器。\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 使得程序可以写得紧凑和可读。用Python编写的程序通常比同等的C、C++或Java程序短得多，这有几个原因。\n",
    "\n",
    "- 高级别的数据类型允许你在一条语句中表达复杂的操作。\n",
    "- 语句分组是通过缩进来完成的，而不是通过开头和结尾的括号。\n",
    "- 不需要变量或参数的声明。\n",
    "\n",
    "Python是可扩展的：如果你知道如何用C语言编程，就很容易在解释器中添加一个新的内置函数或模块，或者以最大的速度执行关键的操作，或者将Python程序与可能只有二进制形式的库相连接（如供应商特定的图形库）。一旦你真的迷上了，你可以把 Python 解释器链接到用 C 写的应用程序中，并把它作为该应用程序的扩展或命令语言。\n",

    "顺便说一下，这种语言是以BBC的节目 \"Monty Python's Flying Circus \"命名的，与爬行动物毫无关系。在文档中引用 Monty Python 的短剧不仅是允许的，而且是被鼓励的。\n",

    "现在你对 Python 感到兴奋了，你会想更详细地研究它。由于学习一种语言的最好方法是使用它，本教程邀请你在阅读时玩玩 Python 解释器。\n",
    "\n",
    "在下一章中，将解释使用解释器的机械原理。这是相当平凡的信息，但对于尝试后面的例子来说是必不可少的。\n",
    "\n",
    "教程的其余部分通过例子介绍了Python语言和系统的各种特性，从简单的表达式、语句和数据类型开始，到函数和模块，最后触及高级概念，如异常和用户定义的类。"
