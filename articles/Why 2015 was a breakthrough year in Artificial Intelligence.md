After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever.

> 在人工智能领域悄无声息地突破了五年之后，2015年是一个具有里程碑意义的年份。计算机比以前更聪明，学习速度也更快。

The pace of advancement in AI is "actually speeding up," said Jeff Dean, a senior fellow at Google. To celebrate their achievements and plot the year ahead, Dean and many of the other top minds in AI are convening in Montreal this week at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference. It started in 1987 and has become a must-attend event for many Silicon Valley companies in the last few years, thanks to the explosion in AI. NIPS was where Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg chose in 2013 to announce the company's plans to form an AI laboratory and where a startup named DeepMind showed off an AI that could learn to play computer games before it was acquired by Google.

> 谷歌的高级研究员杰夫-迪安说，人工智能的进步速度 "实际上正在加快"。为了庆祝他们的成就和规划未来的一年，迪恩和其他许多人工智能领域的顶尖人物本周将在蒙特利尔召开神经信息处理系统会议。该会议始于1987年，在过去的几年里，由于人工智能的爆炸性增长，它已经成为许多硅谷公司必须参加的活动。2013年，Facebook首席执行官马克-扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)选择在NIPS上宣布该公司组建人工智能实验室的计划，一家名为DeepMind的初创公司在被谷歌收购之前也在这里展示了能够学习玩电脑游戏的人工智能。

There should be plenty to discuss this week. The unprecedented advancements in AI research this year can be attributed to a confluence of nerdy factors. For one, cloud computing infrastructure is vastly more powerful and affordable, with the ability to process complex information. There are also more plentiful datasets and free or inexpensive software development tools for researchers to work with. Thanks to this, a crucial class of learning technology, known as neural networks, have gone from being prohibitively expensive to relatively cheap.

> 本周应该有很多东西可以讨论。今年人工智能研究的空前进步可以归功于一系列书呆子因素的汇合。首先，云计算基础设施的功能大大增强，而且价格低廉，具有处理复杂信息的能力。还有更丰富的数据集和免费或廉价的软件开发工具供研究人员使用。得益于此，一类关键的学习技术，即神经网络，已经从令人望而却步的昂贵变为相对便宜。

That's led to rapid uptake by the tech industry's largest companies, including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. Each operates its own AI lab that conducts important research in the field and publishes much of it for the academic community to build upon. This year, Google researchers nabbed the cover of scientific journal *Nature* with a system that can learn to [play and master old Atari games](https://web.archive.org/web/20161123053855/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/google-s-computers-learn-to-play-video-games-by-themselves) without directions. Facebook built a way to let computers describe images to blind people; Microsoft showed off a new Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another; and IBM singled out AI as one of its greatest potential growth areas.

> 这导致了科技行业最大的公司，包括谷歌、Facebook和微软的快速吸收。每个公司都有自己的人工智能实验室，在该领域进行重要的研究，并发表其中的大部分内容供学术界借鉴。今年，谷歌的研究人员在科学杂志《自然》（*Nature*）的封面上刊登了一个系统，该系统可以在没有指导的情况下学习[玩和掌握旧的雅达利游戏](https://web.archive.org/web/20161123053855/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/google-s-computers-learn-to-play-video-games-by-themselves)。脸书建立了一种让计算机向盲人描述图像的方法；微软展示了一个新的Skype系统，可以自动将一种语言翻译成另一种语言；而IBM则将人工智能作为其最大的潜在增长领域之一。

For a look at how far computer intelligence has come this year, here are six charts that should give you a clearer picture.

> 要了解计算机智能在今年取得了多大的进展，这里有六张图表，应该能让你更清楚地了解。

Computers have become a lot better at figuring out what's in a photo. In 2012, a team of University of Toronto researchers won the world's top image-recognition competition. The entire team was eventually recruited by Google, and its approach was quickly adopted by the company and its peers. In 2015, AI systems based on the project's approach, which relies on a technique called deep learning, have become much more accurate. In tests, error rates are down to less than 5 percent, making them better than some humans' performances.

> 计算机在弄清照片中的内容方面已经做得很好。2012年，多伦多大学的一个研究团队赢得了世界顶级的图像识别比赛。整个团队最终被谷歌招募，其方法很快被该公司及其同行采用。2015年，基于该项目方法的人工智能系统已经变得更加准确，该方法依赖于一种叫做深度学习的技术。在测试中，错误率下降到5%以下，使其比一些人类的表现更好。

Lots of companies are embracing AI, perhaps none more than Google. The Internet giant went from sporadic usage of deep learning in 2012 to applying it to thousands of projects this year.

> 很多公司都在拥抱人工智能，也许没有人比谷歌更喜欢。这个互联网巨头从2012年零星使用深度学习，到今年将其应用于数千个项目。

Startups are adopting AI in big ways, too. CrowdFlower, which supplies structured data to companies, said it has seen a dramatic uptick in the amount of data being requested by businesses to help them conduct AI research. DiffBot, another startup, is using AI to improve its automated data-scraping tools.

A main focus of AI research is in teaching computers to think for themselves and improvise solutions to common problems. One way to do that is to give them a slimmed-down version of the real world, such as the simplified environments presented in video games, then ask them to explore it and record the results. (Check out the chart above for a look at how far Google's Atari project has come since 2013.) But the potential goes beyond games: Similar software could be used to teach things to AI computers and help them more quickly learn such new things as medical diagnostics, environmental science, or improved personal recommendations.

> 人工智能研究的一个主要重点是教计算机自己思考并即兴解决常见的问题。做到这一点的一个方法是给他们一个缩小版的真实世界，如视频游戏中呈现的简化环境，然后要求他们探索它并记录结果。(请看上面的图表，看看谷歌的阿塔里项目自2013年以来取得了多大的进展）。但其潜力超越了游戏。类似的软件可用于向人工智能计算机传授知识，帮助它们更快学会诸如医疗诊断、环境科学或改进的个人建议等新事物。

Google's Dean likens recent advancements in AI capabilities to evolution. "We're at this point in actual evolution where, previously, animals didn't have eyes, and now they have eyes," he said. "That's going to change a lot of stuff. Computers used to not be able to see very well, and now they're starting to open their eyes."

> 谷歌的迪安将最近在人工智能能力方面的进步比作进化。"我们正处于实际进化的这一阶段，以前，动物没有眼睛，而现在它们有眼睛，"他说。"这将会改变很多东西。计算机过去不能看得很清楚，而现在它们开始睁开眼睛了。"
