1
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:07,462
When I think about the rise of AI,

2
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:10,674
I'm reminded by the rise of literacy.

3
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:11,925
A few hundred years ago,

4
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:13,510
many people in society thought

5
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:17,472
that maybe not everyone needed
to be able to read and write.

6
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:20,433
Back then, many people were
tending fields or herding sheep,

7
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:23,103
so maybe there was less need
for written communication.

8
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,312
And all that was needed

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:26,731
was for the high priests
and priestesses and monks

10
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,358
to be able to read the Holy Book,

11
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:31,278
and the rest of us could just go
to the temple or church

12
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:32,445
or the holy building

13
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:35,865
and sit and listen to the high priest
and priestesses read to us.

14
00:00:35,907 --> 00:00:39,536
Fortunately, it was since figured out
that we can build a much richer society

15
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:42,038
if lots of people can read and write.

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,710
Today, AI is in the hands
of the high priests and priestesses.

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,753
These are the highly skilled AI engineers,

18
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:51,256
many of whom work
in the big tech companies.

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,385
And most people have access
only to the AI that they build for them.

20
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:58,471
I think that we can build
a much richer society

21
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:02,934
if we can enable everyone
to help to write the future.

22
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:08,398
But why is AI largely concentrated
in the big tech companies?

23
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:11,359
Because many of these AI projects
have been expensive to build.

24
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,279
They may require dozens
of highly skilled engineers,

25
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:17,032
and they may cost millions
or tens of millions of dollars

26
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,700
to build an AI system.

27
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:20,577
And the large tech companies,

28
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:22,954
particularly the ones
with hundreds of millions

29
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,456
or even billions of users,

30
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:28,877
have been better than anyone else
at making these investments pay off

31
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:33,173
because, for them,
a one-size-fits-all AI system,

32
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:35,300
such as one that improves web search

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,303
or that recommends better products
for online shopping,

34
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:41,431
can be applied to [these] very
large numbers of users

35
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,725
to generate a massive amount of revenue.

36
00:01:44,517 --> 00:01:47,896
But this recipe for AI does not work

37
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:52,192
once you go outside the tech
and internet sectors to other places

38
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,485
where, for the most part,

39
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:57,489
there are hardly any projects
that apply to 100 million people

40
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,325
or that generate comparable economics.

41
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,911
Let me illustrate an example.

42
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:09,376
Many weekends, I drive a few minutes
from my house to a local pizza store

43
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,252
to buy a slice of Hawaiian pizza

44
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:14,172
from the gentleman
that owns this pizza store.

45
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:15,715
And his pizza is great,

46
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:19,052
but he always has a lot
of cold pizzas sitting around,

47
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:22,430
and every weekend some different flavor
of pizza is out of stock.

48
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,809
But when I watch him operate his store,

49
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:27,143
I get excited,

50
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:29,354
because by selling pizza,

51
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,815
he is generating data.

52
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,609
And this is data
that he can take advantage of

53
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,070
if he had access to AI.

54
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:43,118
AI systems are good at spotting patterns
when given access to the right data,

55
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,789
and perhaps an AI system could spot
if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well

56
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:48,957
on a Friday night,

57
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:52,669
maybe it could suggest to him
to make more of it on a Friday afternoon.

58
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:56,464
Now you might say to me,
"Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store.

59
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,007
What's the big deal?"

60
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:01,344
And I say, to the gentleman
that owns this pizza store,

61
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:03,722
something that could help him
improve his revenues

62
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:06,933
by a few thousand dollars a year,
that will be a huge deal to him.

63
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:14,274
I know that there is a lot of hype about
AI's need for massive data sets,

64
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:16,234
and having more data does help.

65
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,237
But contrary to the hype,

66
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,989
AI can often work just fine

67
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,116
even on modest amounts of data,

68
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:26,035
such as the data generated
by a single pizza store.

69
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,329
So the real problem is not

70
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,749
that there isn’t enough data
from the pizza store.

71
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,209
The real problem is
that the small pizza store

72
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,836
could never serve enough customers

73
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,214
to justify the cost of hiring an AI team.

74
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,926
I know that in the United States

75
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:44,554
there are about half a million
independent restaurants.

76
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:48,391
And collectively, these restaurants
do serve tens of millions of customers.

77
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:51,102
But every restaurant is different
with a different menu,

78
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:53,688
different customers,
different ways of recording sales

79
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,233
that no one-size-fits-all AI
would work for all of them.

80
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,946
What would it be like
if we could enable small businesses

81
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,866
and especially local businesses to use AI?

82
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,410
Let's take a look
at what it might look like

83
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,205
at a company that makes
and sells T-shirts.

84
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:14,292
I would love if an accountant working
for the T-shirt company

85
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,544
can use AI for demand forecasting.

86
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:19,422
Say, figure out what funny memes
to prints on T-shirts

87
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:20,632
that would drive sales,

88
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:23,092
by looking at what's trending
on social media.

89
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,178
Or for product placement,

90
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,349
why can’t a front-of-store manager
take pictures of what the store looks like

91
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,600
and show it to an AI

92
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:34,687
and have an AI recommend
where to place products to improve sales?

93
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:35,897
Supply chain.

94
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,651
Can an AI recommend to a buyer
whether or not they should pay 20 dollars

95
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,945
per yard for a piece of fabric now,

96
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:43,446
or if they should keep looking

97
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:46,074
because they might be able to find
it cheaper elsewhere?

98
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:47,659
Or quality control.

99
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,537
A quality inspector
should be able to use AI

100
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:55,250
to automatically scan pictures
of the fabric they use to make T-shirts

101
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,503
to check if there are any tears
or discolorations in the cloth.

102
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,425
Today, large tech companies routinely
use AI to solve problems like these

103
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:05,885
and to great effect.

104
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:11,516
But a typical T-shirt company
or a typical auto mechanic

105
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:15,103
or retailer or school or local farm

106
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:18,857
will be using AI for exactly zero
of these applications today.

107
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:24,070
Every T-shirt maker is sufficiently
different from every other T-shirt maker

108
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:27,615
that there is no one-size-fits-all AI
that will work for all of them.

109
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:33,079
And in fact, once you go outside
the internet and tech sectors

110
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,623
in other industries, even large companies

111
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:37,584
such as the pharmaceutical companies,

112
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,586
the car makers, the hospitals,

113
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,296
also struggle with this.

114
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:45,592
This is the long-tail problem of AI.

115
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:50,889
If you were to take all current
and potential AI projects

116
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,143
and sort them in decreasing
order of value and plot them,

117
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:57,020
you get a graph that looks like this.

118
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:59,147
Maybe the single most valuable AI system

119
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:02,483
is something that decides what ads
to show people on the internet.

120
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:05,028
Maybe the second most valuable
is a web search engine,

121
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,990
maybe the third most valuable is an online
shopping product recommendation system.

122
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,160
But when you go
to the right of this curve,

123
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,413
you then get projects
like T-shirt product placement

124
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:19,626
or T-shirt demand forecasting
or pizzeria demand forecasting.

125
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:24,422
And each of these is a unique project
that needs to be custom-built.

126
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,674
Even T-shirt demand forecasting,

127
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:29,844
if it depends on trending memes
on social media,

128
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:34,349
is a very different project
than pizzeria demand forecasting,

129
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,643
if that depends
on the pizzeria sales data.

130
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,812
So today there are millions of projects

131
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:43,316
sitting on the tail of this distribution
that no one is working on,

132
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,818
but whose aggregate value is massive.

133
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:49,572
So how can we enable
small businesses and individuals

134
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:52,367
to build AI systems that matter to them?

135
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,744
For most of the last few decades,

136
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:58,373
if you wanted to build an AI system,
this is what you have to do.

137
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,625
You have to write pages
and pages of code.

138
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,711
And while I would love
for everyone to learn to code,

139
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:06,923
and in fact, online education
and also offline education

140
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:09,759
are helping more people
than ever learn to code,

141
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,137
unfortunately, not everyone
has the time to do this.

142
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,974
But there is an emerging new way

143
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:19,394
to build AI systems
that will let more people participate.

144
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,563
Just as pen and paper,

145
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:26,901
which are a vastly superior technology
to stone tablet and chisel,

146
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:29,612
were instrumental to widespread literacy,

147
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,657
there are emerging new
AI development platforms

148
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,910
that shift the focus from asking you
to write lots of code

149
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:39,080
to asking you to focus on providing data.

150
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:42,333
And this turns out to be much easier
for a lot of people to do.

151
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:47,672
Today, there are multiple companies
working on platforms like these.

152
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:51,968
Let me illustrate a few of the concepts
using one that my team has been building.

153
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,470
Take the example of an inspector

154
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,890
wanting AI to help
detect defects in fabric.

155
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:00,435
An inspector can take
pictures of the fabric

156
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:03,271
and upload it to a platform like this,

157
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:07,233
and they can go in to show the AI
what tears in the fabric look like

158
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,068
by drawing rectangles.

159
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,529
And they can also go in to show the AI

160
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,990
what discoloration
on the fabric looks like

161
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:15,533
by drawing rectangles.

162
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,368
So these pictures,

163
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:19,954
together with the green
and pink rectangles

164
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,247
that the inspector's drawn,

165
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:23,875
are data created by the inspector

166
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,503
to explain to AI how to find
tears and discoloration.

167
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:30,339
After the AI examines this data,

168
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,925
we may find that it has seen
enough pictures of tears,

169
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:35,344
but not yet enough pictures
of discolorations.

170
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:39,765
This is akin to if a junior inspector
had learned to reliably spot tears,

171
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:43,478
but still needs to further hone
their judgment about discolorations.

172
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,148
So the inspector can go back
and take more pictures of discolorations

173
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,316
to show to the AI,

174
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:50,568
to help it deepen this understanding.

175
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:53,112
By adjusting the data you give to the AI,

176
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:55,406
you can help the AI get smarter.

177
00:08:56,282 --> 00:09:00,119
So an inspector using
an accessible platform like this

178
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:03,039
can, in a few hours to a few days,

179
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:07,001
and with purchasing
a suitable camera set up,

180
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:11,631
be able to build a custom AI system
to detect defects,

181
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:13,925
tears and discolorations in all the fabric

182
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:16,469
being used to make T-shirts
throughout the factory.

183
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:19,097
And once again, you may say,

184
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:22,183
"Hey, Andrew, this is one factory.

185
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,601
Why is this a big deal?"

186
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,144
And I say to you,

187
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:28,272
this is a big deal to that inspector
whose life this makes easier

188
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:32,902
and equally, this type of technology
can empower a baker to use AI

189
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:35,404
to check for the quality
of the cakes they're making,

190
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:39,242
or an organic farmer to check
the quality of the vegetables,

191
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:43,329
or a furniture maker to check
the quality of the wood they're using.

192
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,750
Platforms like these will probably
still need a few more years

193
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:51,712
before they're easy enough to use
for every pizzeria owner.

194
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:53,881
But many of these platforms
are coming along,

195
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,092
and some of them
are getting to be quite useful

196
00:09:56,134 --> 00:09:58,553
to someone that is tech savvy today,

197
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,596
with just a bit of training.

198
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,098
But what this means is that,

199
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,809
rather than relying
on the high priests and priestesses

200
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,603
to write AI systems for everyone else,

201
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:10,064
we can start to empower every accountant,

202
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:11,399
every store manager,

203
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,404
every buyer and every quality inspector
to build their own AI systems.

204
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,782
I hope that the pizzeria owner

205
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:22,326
and many other small
business owners like him

206
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:24,871
will also take advantage
of this technology

207
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:28,332
because AI is creating tremendous wealth

208
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:30,710
and will continue to create
tremendous wealth.

209
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,671
And it's only by
democratizing access to AI

210
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:38,134
that we can ensure that this wealth
is spread far and wide across society.

211
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:40,970
Hundreds of years ago.

212
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:44,932
I think hardly anyone
understood the impact

213
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:47,518
that widespread literacy will have.

214
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:50,479
Today, I think hardly anyone understands

215
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:54,108
the impact that democratizing
access to AI will have.

216
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:58,779
Building AI systems has been
out of reach for most people,

217
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,823
but that does not have to be the case.

218
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:03,159
In the coming era for AI,

219
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:06,913
we’ll empower everyone to build
AI systems for themselves,

220
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:09,999
and I think that will be
incredibly exciting future.

221
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,209
Thank you very much.

222
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,214
(Applause)
